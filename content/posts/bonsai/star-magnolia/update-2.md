I got this tree in November and wanted to do some initial wiring on it and start to pull down the major branches that I wanted to keep.

Before well I wrapped but didn't bend):

I broke a few minor branches while trying to put some bend in.  Attempted to fix with superglue, we'll see what happens.  Generally happy with bringing secondary branches closer to horizontal and adding some shape to them.
