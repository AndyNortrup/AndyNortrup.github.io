This is a running log for a Star Magnolia that I acquired from a nursery as a Bonsai project.

## Stats:
* Species: [Magnolia Stellata 'Centennial Blush'](https://firsteditionsplants.com/product/centennial-blush-star-magnolia/)
* Purchased: 2021-11-29
* Purchase Price: $105
* Purchased From: Swanson's Nursery

  * When pruning, don't cut to much. If you do you'll create a lot of vigorous growth and end up with long internodes, which we don't want.
  * Leave some branches on the tree that you intend to keep or don't need to cut now. Let them grow a little long until you eventually cut them off.

  * Responds well to hard chops.
  * Back buds aggressively
  * Don't do any trimming until after it blooms in the spring.
  * Do any trimming before it puts out too much new growth for the year so you can direct that growth. 

## Working Plan
1. Fall / Winter 2021-2022 
   * Basic wiring for main trunks and desired future leads. (Blue lines below)
   * Move into a pond basket and survey the roots.
   * Replace up to 25% of soil with bonsai soil to start rotating out the nursery soil.
2. Spring 2022
   * Wait for flowers to bloom
   * Chop the main trunks (red lines). My goal is to move new growth lower on the tree for a more compact shape and encourage some more thickening of the main trunks.
     * I also need to encourage ramification.  Most of the branches look like the branches were being developed to be a tree in a yard, not a bonsai. I'll be looking to promote secondary branch development.
   * Let it grow for the rest of the year.

I Purchased this Star Magnolia on a bit of a lark when visiting [Swansons Nursery](https://www.swansonsnursery.com/) while we were there to get kids Santa photos. I purchased this tree for $105, which was probably too much. 

Original photos side 1 and side 2.

Things I like:

* It's a more mature tree than I have now. I think that I can move towards an actual bonsai pot in the early spring.
* There is some decent movement in both of the trunks. There is more movement in the thicker of the two trunks. I think I'll keep both trunks.
* I'm excited to have a flowering deciduous tree in my small collection.
* The soil feels pretty compacted I wasn't able to dig in and see what the roots look like with just my fingers.  Some more exploration will be needed once I get to repotting in February.
