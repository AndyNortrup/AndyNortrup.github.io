My particular commute is a multi-stage, adventure that can take an hour on a decent day and mind boggling amounts of time if something goes wrong in Seattle traffic. My spouse and I start by carpooling to our day-care, drop off a kiddo, then catch a bus into downtown, and finally walk across town to my office. Most of the time it works just fine. But it doesn&rsquo;t take much to throw off the whole experience to a post-apocalyptic hell-scape of gridlock. In the past several years, we&rsquo;ve seen car accidents and trucks full of bees or fish completely stop the major high ways and all of the side streets.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/review/>#Review</a></p></p><p><h3><a href=/posts/technology/2019-10-30-the-compliant-news-room/>The Compliant News Room</a></h3>Last Post: 30 Oct 2019<p><p>There has been much ink spilled and great gnashing of teeth over Facebook&rsquo;s news tab and the inclusion of Breitbart as a &ldquo;high quality&rdquo; news source. I continue to be amazed that social media organizations have moved to help establish clear standards and certification for what counts as a high quality newsroom.</p><p>In Enterprise software if you want large companies (like Facebook) to buy your software or services, you will eventually have to get a compliance attestation from a third party auditor that your company follows industry standard practices around code development, testing, deployment, and security. Depending on who your potential customers are there are a cornucopia of potential certifications, SOC2, ISO (lots of these actually), HIPAA for health, PCI for credit cards, FedRAMP for the U.S. Federal government. All of these standards provide you a checklist practices that you have to demonstrate your compliance with, then you find an auditor to come in, look at your books and ask you to prove that you follow your own stated policies.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/society/>#Society</a>

I would rather be interviewed for a job than interview someone for a job. If I have to choose between written and oral communication, I will usually prefer to write. I like async communication because I have time to think clearly and then commit to words what I&rsquo;m thinking. I have a mild central auditory processing disorder, meaning an in-person interview pushes my limits of listening, and critically processing, and taking notes on answers in real time. Critical assessment of the candidate&rsquo;s answer will probably be the functional task that drops.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/technology/>#Technology</a></p></p><p><h3><a href=/posts/product-management/2019-07-06-product-managers-as-scouts/>The Product Manager as Scout</a></h3>Last Post: 6 Jul 2019<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been a product manager for three and a half years after being an Army officer for eight. Never in that time have I felt like I truly owned all of the products I&rsquo;ve worked on. I‚Äôve never had the final say in everything, and I‚Äôve never sat to review that every single story met all of the acceptance criteria. Time, team dynamics, and the nature of working on large complex products precludes any single person from being able to exert that level of control. I‚Äôm largely in agreement John Cutler about the <a href=https://hackernoon.com/we-need-fewer-product-managers-50e47dfd95a0>overload of product manager responsibilities</a> and the danger of centralizing them. I‚Äôm here to propose that product managers should think of themselves as good scouts rather than all controlling owners of the product.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

This exec should be focused on every way that your product could be used for misdeeds.</p><p>The term Devil‚Äôs Advocate is commonly used when someone wants to sound smart in a meeting by being contrary about the topic under discussion. (See: <a href=https://xkcd.com/1432/>https://xkcd.com/1432/</a>) But it‚Äôs original use was as a formal position in the Catholic church to argue against the canonization of individuals to sainthood.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a></p></p><p><h3><a href=/posts/product-management/2017-04-27-continuous-improvement/>Continuous Improvement ‚Äî A Journey</a></h3>Last Post: 27 Apr 2017<p><p>I listened to a great episode of <a href=http://deliveritcast.com/>Deliver It</a> on <a href=http://deliveritcast.com/ep49-devops-for-product-owners>DevOps for Product Owners</a> and a comment by the <a href=https://medium.com/u/ea6cf58a5883>Lee Janson</a> that you don‚Äôt have to have perfect DevOps practices right away really struck home with me. Upon reflection it exactly maps to the evolution that my team has been going through over the past year on our developer tool <a href=https://dev.splunk.com/goto/appinspect>Splunk AppInspect</a>.</p><p>AppInspect is a tool that has grown tremendously in my year with Splunk from a something we built for internal assessment of apps that applied for our <a href=http://dev.splunk.com/view/app-cert/SP-CAAAE2S>Certification Program</a>, to a tool publicly available that as both a standalone CLI tool or through an REST API.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

Lots of staff officers and NCOs standing over a map, drawing symbols on acetate, scribbling notes on paper and into emails and documents.
