Hugo is nice because it creates the RSS feeds that I love to have and use myself. I have been using that RSS feed to drive automated publishing of new articles to social media through Zapier.

I made a tiny tree in a small pot. It was generous to call it a Bonsai and most practitioners would look upon it with a sense of &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cute&rdquo;. Since then, I&rsquo;ve managed to keep that tree alive and now have a collection of trees that I&rsquo;m slowly turning into Bonsai. Along the way I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about horticulture and art, and maybe some things that make me a better product manager along the way.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

Which has been a wild ride and one of my most exciting things I&rsquo;ve done in product in a long time. Here are some early notes by way of an experience report for others who might end up walking this path.</p><p>Some context; when I started this role, I had been at Tanium for two and a half years which is a good amount of time to learn the ins and the outs of the organization. I had spent a fair amount of time back benching on product practice. I had coached a few of the junior product managers and done some rabble-rousing and process suggesting.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

At Splunk I managed the app certification platform that Splunkbase and Cloud relied on. Later I helped build the platform services for Splunk Cloud Services from the ground up. At Tanium I managed the Tanium Data Service which served as a common data layer for all of our modules.</p><p>Being the PM for a deeply technical platform team can be really hard. Unless you come from a deeply technical background it feels hard to have a way to helpfully contribute to that effort. A lot of the work that gets done by a platform team will be very in the weeds, or will be in close execution with the consumer up the stack and their PM on the problem you are trying to solve. You are also more removed from the end-user of the product, which can make empathy and understanding harder. That can make you feel like a glorified project manager.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

One day while we were deployed to Afghanistan I was stressing about something and he very calmly looked at me and told me that I needed to do a better job at accepting that I as an individual was a wholly replaceable cog in the machine. At the time that felt like a hard thing to swallow. I was a primary staff member for a combat squadron in an active combat zone. I felt a little big in my multi-cam britches.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

To do that we have to carefully weight the balance of value to effort in order to properly sequence the infinite set of work that we could be doing.</p><p>Estimating is a tricky and messy business, and I&rsquo;m frequently skeptical of. But when you are trying to prioritize multiple potential projects as a product manager, having some basic numbers can really help things along. This is a system I&rsquo;ve used multiple times to quickly establish baseline value and effort estimates. I like it because it is fast and avoids a lot of hemming and hawing. The goal of this system is to get things in mostly the right order and avoid making big mistakes.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/roadmap/>#Roadmap</a>

As part of building and sorting the ideas and initiatives on your roadmap you will start to show that roadmap to other people. When you do people will have opinions about the order that you have sorted things in. In most cases their opinion will either be agreement, or more commonly, they would like the thing that is important to them to be higher on the list. These differing opinions are good, this is why we build a roadmap. It is better to have those discussions when we are thinking about building things then after we have spent time building something.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/roadmap/>#Roadmap</a>

But the technique is helpful because you can apply the process to help rationalize or refit an existing roadmap. I&rsquo;m a strong believer that you should be able to connect all the work you are doing from top to bottom of the company. A developer should be able to look at any task and put it into the context of the larger solution they are building, the problem it solves for the customer, and the business objective that it supports.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/roadmap/>#Roadmap</a>

Every time I see it I&rsquo;m confused by it because I think of those companies being so far apart in experience that you should spend your time clarifying what you want in a job before trying to pick one or the other. In a hyperscale company there is tremendous specialization for products with billions of users. At a small start up it&rsquo;s all generalists.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>
