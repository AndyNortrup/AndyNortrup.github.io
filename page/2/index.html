As I think back over the arch of my online life, I see these foundational models as the latest in a series of events where amazing technology was going to change the world. But each time individual value is diluted for corporate money grabs.</p><p>Going way back in time, my first real formative experience on the internet was Geocities. When a friend showed me that I could write an HTML file and make it show up on the internet I was hooked. It was magic to me that I could make something the whole world could see. I quickly fell down the rabbit hole of how to make these sites.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/technology/>#Technology</a>

Purchasing and helping Tanium implement it has been one of my primary tools to help improve our prioritization, process, and transparency with the rest of the organization.</p><p>One of my favorite things about Productboard is the ability to super easily document what fields are and how they are supposed to be used immediately inside of the product. I use this all the time to both make my life easier as the person building systems, and it lowers the adoption curve quite a bit for my users. It also feels like a good example of your <a href=https://www.rubick.com/engineering-handbook/>process being open source.</a> Where it is clear it is easy update your process documentation.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

We had a very warm early February, followed by a a cold spell in the second half of the month. Which meant that all the trees woke up, and then had to be shuffled in and out of my workshop.</p><p>But when the trees start to wake up you have to do the work of repotting them before you miss the window. The first tree to wake up is my Start Magnolia which is a very early spring bloomer.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/bonsai/>#Bonsai</a>

It is one of those books like Principals of Product Development Flow that show you why things work at a deeper systemic level that you&rsquo;ve just been emersed in.¬† It&rsquo;s a book that points out the water for the fishes.¬†¬†</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

I was previously generating my list of hashtags to apply to a social post inside of my Zapier workflow. I&rsquo;d pull the list of tags then manipulate them into a single string and add the # symbol.</p><p>Today I realized that this would be much simpler to do in Hugo as part of my JSON output.

Measuring your success based on your customers‚Äô behavior is the only way for you to know for sure whether or not you‚Äôre delivering value and solving a real problem for them. Any user behaviors that are one step removed from your direct influence pose a risk to your key results.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

For example if the mindset is ripe in some parts of the company, say certain product teams, start there. If you don‚Äôt have the infrastructure to run A/B experiments, start discovering your product using surveys, customer interviews, and fake door tests. Don‚Äôt wait for some ‚Äúbig-fix‚Äù that will take ages and may not really fix anything.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-ops/>#Product Ops</a>

I&rsquo;ve been on my friend&rsquo;s Seattle locals instance that he runs as a hobby. I sort of want to run my own instance, but I don&rsquo;t want to think about any of the server operations. I want a hosting provider and I want it t to make it easy.</p><h2 id=content-moderation-is-the-problem>Content moderation is the problem</h2><p>Content moderation is the biggest problem in Social Media, particularly scaled social media. Facebook makes more content moderation decisions every hour than the entire U.S. Justice system has made in it&rsquo;s entire existence. Some of those are really thorny issues that don&rsquo;t have a single solution. And there are some very serious problems with serious legal implications.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/fediverse/>#Fediverse</a>

Paired with the tension between how much we need to change and how fast the organization is able to absorb change.</p><p>Especially as the guardian and manager of the product tool stack. I know that if I set up the tools the way we work now, then everyone will continue the way we are now. If I configure tools how I want us to operate the lift to get everyone using it is harder. If it&rsquo;s hard you have the potential to get people diverting out of or around the tool all together.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-ops/>#Product Ops</a>
