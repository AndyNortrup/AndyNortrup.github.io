I do this with an incredibly ugly Clojure script that I wrote to learn Clojure. But I do think the metrics themselves have been a helpful lens to look at what is happening. Here are some of the questions I ask myself when I sit down to analyze the metrics.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

As he compared that with his organization (a large, well-respected company), he was distressed at the difference between what they saw and what they understood to be best practice. He was even debating if he should leave his current gig to work somewhere he could learn and practice this best-in-class PM craft.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

I started by trying to build a matrix that would serve as an easy key for keeping product managers mostly on the same page for setting the priority field in JIRA. I think there is value in having common standards. But the more I thought about the problem, I got more uncomfortable, because we can&rsquo;t prioritize globally and take into account local context.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

As I&rsquo;ve been talking about it over the past few weeks something really clicked for me on why it&rsquo;s so important to identify the outcomes early in the definition of an idea.</p><p>When you are trying to get work prioritized and on the road map, it&rsquo;s straightforward to start with a name for the solution that conveys meaning and then find supporters who also like the sound of the idea. An easy default is to talk about the solution you are proposing to fix a problem. They go together to help form a narrative story that works well in a meeting. We have this problem, and here is the solution!</p><p>While this is really appealing, it also leaves us some challenges on the backend. If we prioritize problems with a measurement of what we are going to achieve better alignment on why we are trying to solve this problem, and allow ourselves more freedom to discover the right solution.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

This is ultimately an essential evil. Your customers already have a host of enterprise products handling the rest of their workflow. Your product is looking to do something with data coming from or going to another part of the business workflow. No one wants to reenter all of their data into a new system by hand, you need to be part of the ecosystem.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

There are <a href=2015-12-05-Why-a-military-officer-should-be-your-Product-Manager>strong parallels</a> between the roles and product management requires many of the skill sets that effective officers have developed in their time in the service. But believing that you would be a good product manager and actually getting your foot in the door for an interview is another story.</p><p>When applying for roles, I recommend listing your experience in the military as a Product Manager rather than as a &ldquo;Company Commander&rdquo; or &ldquo;Platoon Leader&rdquo;. This will give recruiters and hiring managers something that they are familiar with on your resume and will allow you to open the conversation about how the roles are similar and you are trained for it. It is much better to have a conversation with a recruiter that starts with &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize that the military had Product Managers&rdquo;, to which you can answer, &ldquo;Well my official title was Platoon Leader, but let me tell you about how the roles are very similar&mldr;&rdquo; The alternative is that you don&rsquo;t have any conversations because the recruiting software is literally looking for the words &ldquo;Product Manager&rdquo; in the job titles of your resume and you get filtered out.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

Applications can be built to access and store data in the pod, rather than in storage systems owned by the application.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/technology/>#Technology</a>

Prior to starting my first role at Splunk as a line level Product Manager my previous experience was in the U.S. Army. I didn&rsquo;t know that product management was a career field option when I started my job search, and as I look back on it I&rsquo;m amazed I got any interviews at all. I had no meaningful experience building software, and I made some <a href=/Why-a-military-officer-should-be-your-Product-Manager/>blind assertions</a> that I had qualifying experience as an Army Officer. I still maintain that those assertions holdup, and I think most companies would do well to hire more Junior Military Officers as Junior Product Managers.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

My particular commute is a multi-stage, adventure that can take an hour on a decent day and mind boggling amounts of time if something goes wrong in Seattle traffic. My spouse and I start by carpooling to our day-care, drop off a kiddo, then catch a bus into downtown, and finally walk across town to my office. Most of the time it works just fine. But it doesn&rsquo;t take much to throw off the whole experience to a post-apocalyptic hell-scape of gridlock. In the past several years, we&rsquo;ve seen car accidents and trucks full of bees or fish completely stop the major high ways and all of the side streets.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/review/>#Review</a></p></p><a href=/page/3/>Previous</a> |
