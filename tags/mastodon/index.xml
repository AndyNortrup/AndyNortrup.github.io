But one thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve been exceptionally interested in has been watching multiple newcomers attempt to build offerings on top of the activitypub protocol, then fail dramatically when they realize that while what they have built might be useful for some use cases that it runs into an incredibly hard wall of fediverse culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not speaking hypothetically. In the dying days of 2022 I watched in real-time as this eager young fellow bounced onto the stage and said he had this new full-text thing he was about to launch, it would index all the instances your instance was federated with, and it was carefully built to penetrate various Mastodon blockages. And anyone who didn’t want to be scraped and indexed had to opt out. (He also claimed it was going to be available only to “genuine admins”.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Create a Mastodon Integration for Zapier</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/mastodon-zapier-integration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 13:52:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/mastodon-zapier-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted on GitHub pages using Hugo, mostly because it gives me an excuse to play with very simple CI/CD pipelines and scratch the itch that wishes I was an engineer rather than a product manager. Hugo is nice because it creates the RSS feeds that I love to have and use myself. I have been using that RSS feed to drive automated publishing of new articles to social media through Zapier. The pipeline looks something like this until just recently&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
