I made a tiny tree in a small pot. It was generous to call it a Bonsai and most practitioners would look upon it with a sense of &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s cute&amp;rdquo;. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to keep that tree alive and now have a collection of trees that I&amp;rsquo;m slowly turning into Bonsai. Along the way I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about horticulture and art, and maybe some things that make me a better product manager along the way.</description></item><item><title>Star Magnolia Update</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/bonsai/star-magnolia/update-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 11:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/bonsai/star-magnolia/update-2/</guid><description>2021-12-04 I got this tree in November and wanted to do some initial wiring on it and start to pull down the major branches that I wanted to keep.
Before well I wrapped but didn&amp;rsquo;t bend): I broke a few minor branches while trying to put some bend in. Attempted to fix with superglue, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens. Generally happy with bringing secondary branches closer to horizontal and adding some shape to them.</description></item><item><title>Star Magnolia Bonsai Log / Plan</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/bonsai/star-magnolia/2021-11-29-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/bonsai/star-magnolia/2021-11-29-first-impressions/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a running log for a Star Magnolia that I acquired from a nursery as a Bonsai project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
