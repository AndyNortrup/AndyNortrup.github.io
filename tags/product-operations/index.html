This is a metaphor from my good friend Jack Coates (<a href=https://monkeynoodle.org/2018/09/03/engines-and-fuel-who-writes-quality-content/>Part 1</a> <a href=https://monkeynoodle.org/2020/03/21/engines-and-fuel-part-two/>Part 2)</a> that he usually applies to building end user products that need content, and that no one wants to build content and teams want to build engines because they are fun and sexy. Similarly when you are building process for your product management team you should resist the urge to try and do the work of the process yourself. </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

Both Productboard and JIRA Product Discovery allow you to rate the level of impact that a piece of customer feedback has. If your ratings are all over the map it can be hard to really understand what signals you are getting in your prioritization process.</p><p>In the interest of having some consistency I&rsquo;ve come to like this scale for rating customer interest.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

The question was mostly focused on who inside of the team was responsible. Was that the engineering manager, the PM, the TPM?  Between the four folks who came in mass to my office hours, there were five different ways of managing bug triage.  This was causing some challenges because there was a RACI being built to set expectations.</p><p>I had a very firm &ldquo;No I won&rsquo;t create this standard for you&rdquo;.  And I&rsquo;m here to caution other product leaders and product operations teams not to do it either.  When you are operating a dynamic adaptive system with multiple independent teams.  It is important to be very thoughtful about where and when you set and enforce standards.  Some questions you should ask yourself before establishing a standard that everyone must follow. </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

It&rsquo;s now applied to many different systems thinking and design contexts. This week I was preparing to explain Product Operations to my new CEO and it occured to me that the role of Product Ops is to help power and accelerate the OODA loop for product management teams.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

Purchasing and helping Tanium implement it has been one of my primary tools to help improve our prioritization, process, and transparency with the rest of the organization.</p><p>One of my favorite things about Productboard is the ability to super easily document what fields are and how they are supposed to be used immediately inside of the product. I use this all the time to both make my life easier as the person building systems, and it lowers the adoption curve quite a bit for my users. It also feels like a good example of your <a href=https://www.rubick.com/engineering-handbook/>process being open source.</a> Where it is clear it is easy update your process documentation.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

It is one of those books like Principals of Product Development Flow that show you why things work at a deeper systemic level that you&rsquo;ve just been emersed in.  It&rsquo;s a book that points out the water for the fishes.  </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

For example if the mindset is ripe in some parts of the company, say certain product teams, start there. If you don’t have the infrastructure to run A/B experiments, start discovering your product using surveys, customer interviews, and fake door tests. Don’t wait for some “big-fix” that will take ages and may not really fix anything.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-ops/>#Product Ops</a>

Paired with the tension between how much we need to change and how fast the organization is able to absorb change.</p><p>Especially as the guardian and manager of the product tool stack. I know that if I set up the tools the way we work now, then everyone will continue the way we are now. If I configure tools how I want us to operate the lift to get everyone using it is harder. If it&rsquo;s hard you have the potential to get people diverting out of or around the tool all together.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-ops/>#Product Ops</a>

Which has been a wild ride and one of my most exciting things I&rsquo;ve done in product in a long time. Here are some early notes by way of an experience report for others who might end up walking this path.</p><p>Some context; when I started this role, I had been at Tanium for two and a half years which is a good amount of time to learn the ins and the outs of the organization. I had spent a fair amount of time back benching on product practice. I had coached a few of the junior product managers and done some rabble-rousing and process suggesting.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>
