Upon reflection it exactly maps to the evolution that my team has been going through over the past year on our developer tool &lt;a href="https://dev.splunk.com/goto/appinspect"&gt;Splunk AppInspect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppInspect is a tool that has grown tremendously in my year with Splunk from a something we built for internal assessment of apps that applied for our &lt;a href="http://dev.splunk.com/view/app-cert/SP-CAAAE2S"&gt;Certification Program&lt;/a&gt;, to a tool publicly available that as both a standalone CLI tool or through an REST API.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
