One day while we were deployed to Afghanistan I was stressing about something and he very calmly looked at me and told me that I needed to do a better job at accepting that I as an individual was a wholly replaceable cog in the machine. At the time that felt like a hard thing to swallow.</description></item><item><title>Military to Product Management - Level Equivalents</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/2020-06-06-military-to-pm-levels/index.json</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/2020-06-06-military-to-pm-levels/index.json</guid><description>Military officers interested in moving into technology should consider careers in Product Management. There are strong parallels between the roles and product management requires many of the skill sets that effective officers have developed in their time in the service. But believing that you would be a good product manager and actually getting your foot in the door for an interview is another story.
When applying for roles, I recommend listing your experience in the military as a Product Manager rather than as a &amp;ldquo;Company Commander&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Platoon Leader&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>The Product Manager as Scout</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/2019-07-06-product-managers-as-scouts/index.json</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/2019-07-06-product-managers-as-scouts/index.json</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a product manager for three and a half years after being an Army officer for eight. Never in that time have I felt like I truly owned all of the products I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. I’ve never had the final say in everything, and I’ve never sat to review that every single story met all of the acceptance criteria. Time, team dynamics, and the nature of working on large complex products precludes any single person from being able to exert that level of control.</description></item><item><title>Why a military officer should be your Product Manager</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/2015-12-05-why-a-military-officer-should-be-your-product-manager/index.json</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/2015-12-05-why-a-military-officer-should-be-your-product-manager/index.json</guid><description>Ken Norton in an effort to help companies understand how to hire product managers wrote a guide: How to Hire a Product Manager I’m here to argue that the person you are looking for might just be a transitioning or former military officer. I have never been a Product Manager, but I have spent the last eight years as an officer in the United States Army, I’ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing peers and the honor of leading, coaching and mentoring some very promising young lieutenants.</description></item><item><title>Army Brigades are built on agile.</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/military/2015-04-30-army-brigades-are-built-on-agile/index.json</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/military/2015-04-30-army-brigades-are-built-on-agile/index.json</guid><description>&lt;p>Michael Cata’s wrote a smart &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@michaelccata/joint-forces-of-change-fe109acf2885">article&lt;/a> discussing the Department of Defense is reacting to changing events with agility.

Lots of staff officers and NCOs standing over a map, drawing symbols on acetate, scribbling notes on paper and into emails and documents. Once the drawing is done one or several staff officers walks away from the table and copies all of the graphics onto power point slides and the Command Post of the Future (CPoF).</description></item></channel></rss>
