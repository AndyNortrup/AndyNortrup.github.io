One day while we were deployed to Afghanistan I was stressing about something and he very calmly looked at me and told me that I needed to do a better job at accepting that I as an individual was a wholly replaceable cog in the machine. At the time that felt like a hard thing to swallow. I was a primary staff member for a combat squadron in an active combat zone. I felt a little big in my multi-cam britches.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

There are <a href=2015-12-05-Why-a-military-officer-should-be-your-Product-Manager>strong parallels</a> between the roles and product management requires many of the skill sets that effective officers have developed in their time in the service. But believing that you would be a good product manager and actually getting your foot in the door for an interview is another story.</p><p>When applying for roles, I recommend listing your experience in the military as a Product Manager rather than as a &ldquo;Company Commander&rdquo; or &ldquo;Platoon Leader&rdquo;. This will give recruiters and hiring managers something that they are familiar with on your resume and will allow you to open the conversation about how the roles are similar and you are trained for it. It is much better to have a conversation with a recruiter that starts with &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize that the military had Product Managers&rdquo;, to which you can answer, &ldquo;Well my official title was Platoon Leader, but let me tell you about how the roles are very similar&mldr;&rdquo; The alternative is that you don&rsquo;t have any conversations because the recruiting software is literally looking for the words &ldquo;Product Manager&rdquo; in the job titles of your resume and you get filtered out.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

Never in that time have I felt like I truly owned all of the products I&rsquo;ve worked on. I’ve never had the final say in everything, and I’ve never sat to review that every single story met all of the acceptance criteria. Time, team dynamics, and the nature of working on large complex products precludes any single person from being able to exert that level of control. I’m largely in agreement John Cutler about the <a href=https://hackernoon.com/we-need-fewer-product-managers-50e47dfd95a0>overload of product manager responsibilities</a> and the danger of centralizing them. I’m here to propose that product managers should think of themselves as good scouts rather than all controlling owners of the product.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

I have never been a Product Manager, but I have spent the last eight years as an officer in the United States Army, I’ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing peers and the honor of leading, coaching and mentoring some very promising young lieutenants.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/military/>#Military</a>

Lots of staff officers and NCOs standing over a map, drawing symbols on acetate, scribbling notes on paper and into emails and documents. Once the drawing is done one or several staff officers walks away from the table and copies all of the graphics onto power point slides and the Command Post of the Future (CPoF).
