As I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about it over the past few weeks something really clicked for me on why it&amp;rsquo;s so important to identify the outcomes early in the definition of an idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are trying to get work prioritized and on the road map, it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward to start with a name for the solution that conveys meaning and then find supporters who also like the sound of the idea. An easy default is to talk about the solution you are proposing to fix a problem. They go together to help form a narrative story that works well in a meeting. We have this problem, and here is the solution!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this is really appealing, it also leaves us some challenges on the backend. If we prioritize problems with a measurement of what we are going to achieve better alignment on why we are trying to solve this problem, and allow ourselves more freedom to discover the right solution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
