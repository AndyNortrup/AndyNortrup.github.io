Prior to starting my first role at Splunk as a line level Product Manager my previous experience was in the U.S. Army. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that product management was a career field option when I started my job search, and as I look back on it I&amp;rsquo;m amazed I got any interviews at all. I had no meaningful experience building software, and I made some blind assertions that I had qualifying experience as an Army Officer.</description></item></channel></rss>
