Before well I wrapped but didn&amp;rsquo;t bend): I broke a few minor branches while trying to put some bend in. Attempted to fix with superglue, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens. Generally happy with bringing secondary branches closer to horizontal and adding some shape to them.</description></item><item><title>Star Magnolia Bonsai Log / Plan</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/bonsai/star-magnolia/2021-11-29-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/bonsai/star-magnolia/2021-11-29-first-impressions/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a running log for a Star Magnolia that I acquired from a nursery as a Bonsai project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
