Both Productboard and JIRA Product Discovery allow you to rate the level of impact that a piece of customer feedback has. If your ratings are all over the map it can be hard to really understand what signals you are getting in your prioritization process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the interest of having some consistency I&amp;rsquo;ve come to like this scale for rating customer interest.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Link Roundup 2023-02-25</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/link-roundup/2023-02-25-link-roundup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 12:03:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/link-roundup/2023-02-25-link-roundup/</guid><description>&lt;p>A quick roundup of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading and enjoying this week&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Start using outcome goals right now where you can. For example if the mindset is ripe in some parts of the company, say certain product teams, start there. If you don’t have the infrastructure to run A/B experiments, start discovering your product using surveys, customer interviews, and fake door tests. Don’t wait for some “big-fix” that will take ages and may not really fix anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tensions in Product Ops Tool Design</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/tension-in-product-ops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 08:11:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/tension-in-product-ops/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think my core challenge with Product Ops, particularly standing it up from scratch, is the tension for modeling systems and processes as they are now vs how I want them to be. Paired with the tension between how much we need to change and how fast the organization is able to absorb change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially as the guardian and manager of the product tool stack. I know that if I set up the tools the way we work now, then everyone will continue the way we are now. If I configure tools how I want us to operate the lift to get everyone using it is harder. If it&amp;rsquo;s hard you have the potential to get people diverting out of or around the tool all together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Product Operations First Take</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/product-ops-first-take/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 21:36:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/product-management/product-ops-first-take/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently took on the role of Product Operations at Tanium. Which has been a wild ride and one of my most exciting things I&amp;rsquo;ve done in product in a long time. Here are some early notes by way of an experience report for others who might end up walking this path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some context; when I started this role, I had been at Tanium for two and a half years which is a good amount of time to learn the ins and the outs of the organization. I had spent a fair amount of time back benching on product practice. I had coached a few of the junior product managers and done some rabble-rousing and process suggesting.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
