In that declaration they enumerated their list of greivences against the King of England. Today we find our own President behaving much like a wannabe king. Perhaps it is time to return to the sense of outrage that our founders found in the abuses of the king. This is not a call to revolution or violence, but a reminder of our founding values and ideas that should offend our sensibilities and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
