I made a career transition into Product Management four years ago.  Prior to starting my first role at Splunk as a line level Product Manager my previous experience was in the U.S. Army.  I didn't know that product management was a career field option when I started my job search, and as I look back on it I'm amazed I got any interviews at all.  I had no meaningful experience building software, and I made some [blind assertions](/Why-a-military-officer-should-be-your-Product-Manager/) that I had qualifying experience as an Army Officer. I still maintain that those assertions holdup, and I think most companies would do well to hire more Junior Military Officers as Junior Product Managers.

Once I managed to find a job, I've faced the task of educating myself on the craft of being a product manager is.  I've long been a person who learns well through self-study.  I blame the Army that taught that professional development was 1/3 on the job, 1/3 in the class room, and 1/3 personal development.  It's also possible I've just always been a nerd.

Below you will find a list of books, blogs and podcasts that I've read and strongly recommend.  If I were hired or tasked to start an associate product management training program at a company.  Most of the content here would constitute my curriculum. Now you can have the benefit of that without having to listen to me lecture.

### But what about all those posts on Medium?
I tend towards books rather than the plethora of Medium posts because I think you can find lots of half-baked things on medium.  I personally have published there (now here), and opined on my views of what product management is to me.  But I'm a bit of an institutionalist and I tend to give some more credence to folks who gone through the effort of getting something formally published.  Continuing to read on the internet is great, but I think it can be a bit hard to follow if you are trying to establish some foundations.

## What is the job
This section includes several great books to get started understanding what product management is.  If you haven't worked somewhere that has product managers as a role, start here.  Also start here if you feel like people keep saying things about what product managers should be doing and they don't all quite make sense. 

### [Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/149197379X?ie=UTF8&tag=nortrupdev-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=149197379X)

From the author: 
> To stay competitive in today’s market, organizations need to adopt a culture of customer-centric practices that focus on outcomes rather than outputs. Companies that live and die by outputs often fall into the "build trap," cranking out features to meet their schedule rather than the customer’s needs.
>
> In this book, Melissa Perri explains how laying the foundation for great product management can help companies solve real customer problems while achieving business goals. By understanding how to communicate and collaborate within a company structure, you can create a product culture that benefits both the business and the customer. You’ll learn product management principles that can be applied to any organization, big or small.

Andy's take:
I think this is probably the best book I've read on what Product Management is.  It explains it clearly if you are learning how to interface with product management for the first time, if you are trying to build a product management organization, or want to understand how product management organizations are structured and organized to be effective and focused on customer problems. 

If you want to get the essential understanding of what product management is, start here.

### [Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and Build Successful Teams](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491960604?ie=UTF8&tag=nortrupdev-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1491960604)

From the author:
> In today’s lightning-fast technology world, good product management is critical to maintaining a competitive advantage. Yet, managing human beings and navigating complex product roadmaps is no easy task, and it’s rare to find a product leader who can steward a digital product from concept to launch without a couple of major hiccups. Why do some product leaders succeed while others don’t?
>
> This insightful book presents interviews with nearly 100 leading product managers from all over the world. Authors Richard Banfield, Martin Eriksson, and Nate Walkingshaw draw on decades of experience in product design and development to capture the approaches, styles, insights, and techniques of successful product managers. If you want to understand what drives good product leaders, this book is an irreplaceable resource.

Andy's Take:

1. The Authors are Pillars of the product management community.  As the collective founders of Mind the Product they represent an enormous mind-share about what it means to build products in today's software ecosystem. 
2. I love that this book takes a broad vision of what a product leader is. There can be a tendency to draw sharp lines between people by title and what they do. (Engineering Managers and Engineers should stick to engineering and Product Managers think about product things!) This book is more inclusive and I think represents reality better, Product Managers, Engineers, UX/UI, Docs are all part of the Product Leadership team of a company.  
3. They do a great job talking about what it means to do product at different sized and staged companies.  Startups, mid-sized companies, and enterprise companies all have a very different feel, they work in different ways.  Reading this section of the book if you are trying to break into product management is a good way to understand what kind of company you are looking to apply to.

### [Building Products for the Enterprise: Product Management in Enterprise Software](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BC56G9H?ie=UTF8&tag=nortrupdev-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B07BC56G9H)

From the author:
>If you’re new to software product management or just want to learn more about it, there’s plenty of advice available—but most of it is geared toward consumer products. Creating high-quality software for the enterprise involves a much different set of challenges. In this practical book, two expert product managers provide straightforward guidance for people looking to join the thriving enterprise market.
>
> Authors [Blair Reeves](https://twitter.com/BlairReeves) and (Benjamin Gaines)[https://twitter.com/benjamingaines] explain critical differences between enterprise and consumer products, and deliver strategies for overcoming challenges when building for the enterprise. You’ll learn how to cultivate knowledge of your organization, the products you build, and the industry you serve.

My first (currently only) experience in software is in Enterprise Software.  So I was thrilled to learn that there was a book specifically about building product for Enterprise Software.  In this case Enterprise Software is referring to the companies you are trying to sell to, not so much the type of company you are.  There are plenty of startups and mid-sized companies that are trying to sell to Enterprise Customers.  But selling to an Enterprise customer has very distinct sales motions, support requirements, cadences, that are, as far as I can tell, nothing like consumer products.

This book has a great overview on how to work with the many different parts of this process.  Understanding who you are building for, how your organization works, how to think about your industry.  Read this if you are going to be selling to companies, particularly big ones, rather than individual people.

As a final note I also like Blair, he's got an a strong twitter game, an occasional newsletter, and we've become somewhat Twitter friends. He has a much bigger following than me, but we've corresponded multiple times and he's always genuine and smart. Be aware that his twitter goes overtly political quite often, which is fine with me, but truth in lending if you want just the product stuff.

## Methods and tools

### [User Story Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491904909?ie=UTF8&tag=nortrupdev-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1491904909)

From the author: 
> User story mapping is a valuable tool for software development, once you understand why and how to use it. This insightful book examines how this often misunderstood technique can help your team stay focused on users and their needs without getting lost in the enthusiasm for individual product features.

Andy's take:

User story mapping is by far my favorite design technique. I use it whenever I get the opportunity. I find that it provides a clear and easy way to communicate what the user is trying to accomplish.  It helps visualize the flow, discuss sequencing and priorities and does a great job of drawing out missing steps.  I also love that the technique is easy to explain and understand. It's simple to implement, while there are tools out there to build a story map, I've also effectively built story maps in a spreadsheet so that I could project it when I'm working with distributed teams or multiple co-located teams in different cities.

Also Jeff Patton is a giant the industry, when he speaks or writes something I perk up and listen (see the recurring resources)


### [The North Star Playbook](https://amplitude.com/north-star)

John Cutler is one of the most prolific writers I know on Product Management, his newsletter is further down the list of continuing education. At time of writing he works at Amplitude which is a tool focused on helping Product Managers understand how users use their products.  Working with his peers at Amplitude they've written this terrific guide to picking strategic metrics.  Having a clear strategic metric can be incredibly grounding for a team and helps tremendously when you are trying to prioritize work with your teams.  It gives you the magic power to say to a stakeholder a clear articulation of why you prioritized one thing over another.
