In that declaration they enumerated their list of grievances against the King of England. Today we find our own President behaving much like a wannabe king. Perhaps it is time to return to the sense of outrage that our founders found in the abuses of the king. This is not a call to revolution or violence, but a reminder of our founding values and ideas that should offend our sensibilities and traditions.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/politics/>#Politics</a>

In order to be a professional, you must perform that function with high enough quality, consistently, over time, fast enough to pay the bills. People pay for quality. The higher and more consistent the quality, the more they will pay.</p><p>If you can&rsquo;t produce high enough quality work that people want to pay you for it, you aren&rsquo;t a professional.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product-Management</a></p></p><p><h3><a href=/posts/technology/yoto-mini-teardown-and-rescue/>Yoto Mini Teardown and Rescue</a></h3>Last Post: 14 Jan 2024<p><p>Yesterday my daughter&rsquo;s Yoto mini took a dunk in the bathtub. She was devastated, she uses it almost constantly. So it was Dad to the rescue.  The device was straight forward to take apart, but I wanted to share how I did it so that other parents don&rsquo;t have to figure it out on the fly.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/technology/>#Technology</a>

This is a metaphor from my good friend Jack Coates (<a href=https://monkeynoodle.org/2018/09/03/engines-and-fuel-who-writes-quality-content/>Part 1</a> <a href=https://monkeynoodle.org/2020/03/21/engines-and-fuel-part-two/>Part 2)</a> that he usually applies to building end user products that need content, and that no one wants to build content and teams want to build engines because they are fun and sexy. Similarly when you are building process for your product management team you should resist the urge to try and do the work of the process yourself. </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

How much work can the team do at the same time? Or it gets a historical example from Toyota about kanban cards and spots on a pallet, which doesn&rsquo;t make a ton of sense if you&rsquo;ve never worked in a factory.</p><p>Today I have a more concrete example, the kitchen sink and putting the dishes away. My system of washing the dishes starts at the dining room table, goes to the dishwasher or sink then goes back to the drying rack or the cabinets</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/work-in-progress/>#Work in Progress</a></p></p><p><h3><a href=/posts/product-management/rating-customer-insights/>Rating Customer Insights</a></h3>Last Post: 14 Dec 2023<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on implementing Product Management tools for the last year in one way or another. Both Productboard and JIRA Product Discovery allow you to rate the level of impact that a piece of customer feedback has. If your ratings are all over the map it can be hard to really understand what signals you are getting in your prioritization process.</p><p>In the interest of having some consistency I&rsquo;ve come to like this scale for rating customer interest.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product-Management</a>

It was a distinct pleasure and the first wedding I&rsquo;ve ever been asked to officiate. My remarks were well received so I wanted to share them here in case they are useful to someone else. There are some minor changes I wrote on my script in the weekend before the wedding, but this is the script I started with.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/wedding/>#Wedding</a></p></p><p><h3><a href=/posts/product-management/keep-your-standards-to-a-minimum/>Keep Your Standards to a Minimum</a></h3>Last Post: 13 Sep 2023<p><p>I recently had a conversation with several Product Managers  at work who wanted me to step in and set a standard for how and who was responsible for triaging bugs reported to their teams. The question was mostly focused on who inside of the team was responsible. Was that the engineering manager, the PM, the TPM?  Between the four folks who came in mass to my office hours, there were five different ways of managing bug triage.  This was causing some challenges because there was a RACI being built to set expectations.</p><p>I had a very firm &ldquo;No I won&rsquo;t create this standard for you&rdquo;.  And I&rsquo;m here to caution other product leaders and product operations teams not to do it either.  When you are operating a dynamic adaptive system with multiple independent teams.  It is important to be very thoughtful about where and when you set and enforce standards.  Some questions you should ask yourself before establishing a standard that everyone must follow. </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

It&rsquo;s now applied to many different systems thinking and design contexts. This week I was preparing to explain Product Operations to my new CEO and it occured to me that the role of Product Ops is to help power and accelerate the OODA loop for product management teams.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

I came across <a href=https://keyoxide.org/>Keyoxide</a> which seems like a great way to start gluing your identities together, but is not yet user friendly.
