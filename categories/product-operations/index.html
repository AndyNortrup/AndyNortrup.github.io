Purchasing and helping Tanium implement it has been one of my primary tools to help improve our prioritization, process, and transparency with the rest of the organization.</p><p>One of my favorite things about Productboard is the ability to super easily document what fields are and how they are supposed to be used immediately inside of the product. I use this all the time to both make my life easier as the person building systems, and it lowers the adoption curve quite a bit for my users. It also feels like a good example of your <a href=https://www.rubick.com/engineering-handbook/>process being open source.</a> Where it is clear it is easy update your process documentation.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

Paired with the tension between how much we need to change and how fast the organization is able to absorb change.</p><p>Especially as the guardian and manager of the product tool stack. I know that if I set up the tools the way we work now, then everyone will continue the way we are now. If I configure tools how I want us to operate the lift to get everyone using it is harder. If it&rsquo;s hard you have the potential to get people diverting out of or around the tool all together.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-ops/>#Product Ops</a>

Which has been a wild ride and one of my most exciting things I&rsquo;ve done in product in a long time. Here are some early notes by way of an experience report for others who might end up walking this path.</p><p>Some context; when I started this role, I had been at Tanium for two and a half years which is a good amount of time to learn the ins and the outs of the organization. I had spent a fair amount of time back benching on product practice. I had coached a few of the junior product managers and done some rabble-rousing and process suggesting.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>
