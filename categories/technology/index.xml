First it was Twitter, now Reddit is seeing an exodus to Lemmy, there is also Pixelfed to replace instagram and bookwyrm to replace Goodreads.
It&amp;rsquo;s great. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t without its problems.
No consistent Identity We don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear identity federation system. I came across Keyoxide which seems like a great way to start gluing your identities together, but is not yet user friendly.</description><category term="fediverse" label="Fediverse"/><category term="solid" label="Solid"/></item><item><title>LLMs - I won't be fooled again</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/llm-skepticism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 20:34:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/llm-skepticism/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve stayed on the sidelines of much of the LLM debate, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to stake out my skepticism on this &amp;ldquo;world changing&amp;rdquo; technology. As I think back over the arch of my online life, I see these foundational models as the latest in a series of events where amazing technology was going to change the world. But each time individual value is diluted for corporate money grabs.
Going way back in time, my first real formative experience on the internet was Geocities.</description><category term="technology" label="Technology"/><category term="llms" label="LLMs"/><category term="ai" label="AI"/></item><item><title>Hashtag strings in Hugo</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/hashtag-strings-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/hashtag-strings-in-hugo/</guid><description>I did a fun bit of Hugo templating today that seemed worth sharing. I was previously generating my list of hashtags to apply to a social post inside of my Zapier workflow. I&amp;rsquo;d pull the list of tags then manipulate them into a single string and add the # symbol.
Today I realized that this would be much simpler to do in Hugo as part of my JSON output. It came out like this:</description><category term="technology" label="Technology"/><category term="hugo" label="Hugo"/></item><item><title>Fediverse Hosting Wishlist</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2023-02-10-mastodon-hosting-wishlist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 14:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2023-02-10-mastodon-hosting-wishlist/</guid><description>I want the Fediverse to succeed, but it needs to be easy for laypersons to start and run their own small communities, here is how to make it work.</description><category term="fediverse" label="Fediverse"/><category term="mastodon" label="Mastodon"/></item><item><title>Create a Mastodon Integration for Zapier</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/mastodon-zapier-integration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 13:52:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/mastodon-zapier-integration/</guid><description>This site is hosted on GitHub pages using Hugo, mostly because it gives me an excuse to play with very simple CI/CD pipelines and scratch the itch that wishes I was an engineer rather than a product manager. Hugo is nice because it creates the RSS feeds that I love to have and use myself. I have been using that RSS feed to drive automated publishing of new articles to social media through Zapier.</description><category term="mastodon" label="Mastodon"/><category term="zapier" label="Zapier"/><category term="hugo" label="Hugo"/></item><item><title>Solid Pods - A better place to store user data</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2020-05-13-solid-pods/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2020-05-13-solid-pods/</guid><description>Solid Pods (Personal Online Data Store) are an open source project from the efforts of Sir Tim Berners-Lee (creator of the original internet) with a goal of re-decentralizing the internet. This project is still in development, I think it has a lot to offer in order to help make developing web applications easier and safer for the developer, user, and society at large.
Solid provides a web standard&amp;rsquo;s compliant API to provide the owner of the pod with an identity (WebID), storage (document store), and relational language for data.</description><category term="technology" label="Technology"/><category term="open-source" label="Open Source"/></item><item><title>One Wheel Pint - An Honest Review</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2020-01-02-onewheel-pint-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2020-01-02-onewheel-pint-review/</guid><description>Commuting is a pain. My particular commute is a multi-stage, adventure that can take an hour on a decent day and mind boggling amounts of time if something goes wrong in Seattle traffic. My spouse and I start by carpooling to our day-care, drop off a kiddo, then catch a bus into downtown, and finally walk across town to my office. Most of the time it works just fine. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much to throw off the whole experience to a post-apocalyptic hell-scape of gridlock.</description><category term="review" label="Review"/></item><item><title>The Compliant News Room</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2019-10-30-the-compliant-news-room/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2019-10-30-the-compliant-news-room/</guid><description>There has been much ink spilled and great gnashing of teeth over Facebook&amp;rsquo;s news tab and the inclusion of Breitbart as a &amp;ldquo;high quality&amp;rdquo; news source. I continue to be amazed that social media organizations have moved to help establish clear standards and certification for what counts as a high quality newsroom.
In Enterprise software if you want large companies (like Facebook) to buy your software or services, you will eventually have to get a compliance attestation from a third party auditor that your company follows industry standard practices around code development, testing, deployment, and security.</description><category term="society" label="Society"/><category term="news" label="News"/></item><item><title>The Email Interview</title><link>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2019-07-10-the-email-interview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2019-07-10-the-email-interview/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like conducting interviews. I would rather be interviewed for a job than interview someone for a job. If I have to choose between written and oral communication, I will usually prefer to write. I like async communication because I have time to think clearly and then commit to words what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking. I have a mild central auditory processing disorder, meaning an in-person interview pushes my limits of listening, and critically processing, and taking notes on answers in real time.</description><category term="technology" label="Technology"/></item></channel></rss>
