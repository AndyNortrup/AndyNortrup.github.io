This is a metaphor from my good friend Jack Coates (<a href=https://monkeynoodle.org/2018/09/03/engines-and-fuel-who-writes-quality-content/>Part 1</a> <a href=https://monkeynoodle.org/2020/03/21/engines-and-fuel-part-two/>Part 2)</a> that he usually applies to building end user products that need content, and that no one wants to build content and teams want to build engines because they are fun and sexy. Similarly when you are building process for your product management team you should resist the urge to try and do the work of the process yourself. </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

The question was mostly focused on who inside of the team was responsible. Was that the engineering manager, the PM, the TPM?  Between the four folks who came in mass to my office hours, there were five different ways of managing bug triage.  This was causing some challenges because there was a RACI being built to set expectations.</p><p>I had a very firm &ldquo;No I won&rsquo;t create this standard for you&rdquo;.  And I&rsquo;m here to caution other product leaders and product operations teams not to do it either.  When you are operating a dynamic adaptive system with multiple independent teams.  It is important to be very thoughtful about where and when you set and enforce standards.  Some questions you should ask yourself before establishing a standard that everyone must follow. </p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-operations/>#Product Operations</a>

Since then, I&rsquo;ve managed to keep that tree alive and now have a collection of trees that I&rsquo;m slowly turning into Bonsai.

At Splunk I managed the app certification platform that Splunkbase and Cloud relied on. Later I helped build the platform services for Splunk Cloud Services from the ground up. At Tanium I managed the Tanium Data Service which served as a common data layer for all of our modules.</p><p>Being the PM for a deeply technical platform team can be really hard. Unless you come from a deeply technical background it feels hard to have a way to helpfully contribute to that effort. A lot of the work that gets done by a platform team will be very in the weeds, or will be in close execution with the consumer up the stack and their PM on the problem you are trying to solve. You are also more removed from the end-user of the product, which can make empathy and understanding harder. That can make you feel like a glorified project manager.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a>

As part of building and sorting the ideas and initiatives on your roadmap you will start to show that roadmap to other people. When you do people will have opinions about the order that you have sorted things in. In most cases their opinion will either be agreement, or more commonly, they would like the thing that is important to them to be higher on the list. These differing opinions are good, this is why we build a roadmap. It is better to have those discussions when we are thinking about building things then after we have spent time building something.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/roadmap/>#Roadmap</a>

To do that we have to carefully weight the balance of value to effort in order to properly sequence the infinite set of work that we could be doing.</p><p>Estimating is a tricky and messy business, and I&rsquo;m frequently skeptical of. But when you are trying to prioritize multiple potential projects as a product manager, having some basic numbers can really help things along. This is a system I&rsquo;ve used multiple times to quickly establish baseline value and effort estimates. I like it because it is fast and avoids a lot of hemming and hawing.

As I&rsquo;ve been talking about it over the past few weeks something really clicked for me on why it&rsquo;s so important to identify the outcomes early in the definition of an idea.</p><p>When you are trying to get work prioritized and on the road map, it&rsquo;s straightforward to start with a name for the solution that conveys meaning and then find supporters who also like the sound of the idea. An easy default is to talk about the solution you are proposing to fix a problem. They go together to help form a narrative story that works well in a meeting. We have this problem, and here is the solution!</p><p>While this is really appealing, it also leaves us some challenges on the backend.

I have never been a Product Manager, but I have spent the last eight years as an officer in the United States Army, I’ve had the pleasure of working with some amazing peers and the honor of leading, coaching and mentoring some very promising young lieutenants.</p></p><p><a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/military/>#Military</a>
