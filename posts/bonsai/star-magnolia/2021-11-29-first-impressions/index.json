If you do you\u0026rsquo;ll create a lot of vigorous growth and end up with long internodes, which we don\u0026rsquo;t want. Leave some branches on the tree that you intend to keep or don\u0026rsquo;t need to cut now. Let them grow a little long until you eventually cut them off.   International Bonsai 2007 no. 1 Spring Flowering Bonsai - Developing Magnolia Bonsai Reddit Conversation on keeping this alive.  Responds well to hard chops. Back buds aggressively Don\u0026rsquo;t do any trimming until after it blooms in the spring. Do any trimming before it puts out too much new growth for the year so you can direct that growth.    Working Plan  Fall / Winter 2021-2022  Basic wiring for main trunks and desired future leads. (Blue lines below) Move into a pond basket and survey the roots.

I purchased this tree for $105, which was probably too much.\nOriginal photos side 1 and side 2. Things I like:\n It\u0026rsquo;s a more mature tree than I have now. I think that I can move towards an actual bonsai pot in the early spring. There is some decent movement in both of the trunks. There is more movement in the thicker of the two trunks. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll keep both trunks. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to have a flowering deciduous tree in my small collection. The soil feels pretty compacted I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to dig in and see what the roots look like with just my fingers. Some more exploration will be needed once I get to repotting in February.
