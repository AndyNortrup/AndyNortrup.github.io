<a href=https://www.nortrup.dev/tags/product-management/>#Product Management</a></p>28 Jan 2023<p>I think my core challenge with Product Ops, particularly standing it up from scratch, is the tension for modeling systems and processes as they are now vs how I want them to be. Paired with the tension between how much we need to change and how fast the organization is able to absorb change.</p><p>Especially as the guardian and manager of the product tool stack. I know that if I set up the tools the way we work now, then everyone will continue the way we are now. If I configure tools how I want us to operate the lift to get everyone using it is harder. If it&rsquo;s hard you have the potential to get people diverting out of or around the tool all together.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve hit this a lot recently as I&rsquo;ve been getting us established in a product management tool and attempting to set good practices. We bought the tool because we knew we needed to fill a gap in how we were planning and communicating. But it makes every configuration choice a change management event.</p><p>On top of that, because it&rsquo;s a new tool and a design process to set it up and get it working for the team you have to iterate. Sometimes I make suboptimal changes in the organization, naming or process. The line between agile discovery, implementation and change management is squiggly and a gradient.</p><p>Practices that are working for me.</p><ol><li>Create new views and tools privately first.</li><li>Find members of the team you can trust for a variety of feedback.</li><li>Write some documentation to clarify intent.</li><li>Patience</li><li>Adjust as needed</li></ol></main></div></div><hr><div class=footer><a href="https://shareopenly.org/share/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nortrup.dev%2fposts%2fbonsai%2fstar-magnolia%2f2021-11-29-first-impressions%2f&text=Star%20Magnolia%20Bonsai%20Log%20%2f%20Plan">Share This</a>
