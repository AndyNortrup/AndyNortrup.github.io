If you want something to move up the stack you need to convince the PM that it is either more valuable or eaiser to build. If you want to drive something down the backlog (because sabotage is a strategy) then you need to convince the PM that it is less valuable and harder to build. So let&rsquo;s outline some decent reasons to move those numbers around. These are some patterns of prioritization that you can use to help clarify the discussion.</p><h3 id=more-important>More important</h3><ul><li>More strongly supports one or more business goals or OKR</li><li>Unlocks another initiative that is higher ranked.</li><li>Feature or step must be part of a first release</li><li>Strong customer demand</li><li>Customers are upset this isn&rsquo;t fixed yet</li></ul><h3 id=less-important>Less important</h3><ul><li>Unlikely advance a stated business goal</li><li>Lack of executive sponsorship</li><li>No one has actually asked for this / lack of clear interest</li><li>People have said they want it but not that they would pay for it</li></ul><h3 id=easier-to-build>Easier to Build</h3><ul><li>Similar to something already built</li><li>Prior art and recommended practices to draw from</li><li>Open-source components can be utilized</li><li>Decreasing the success criteria (you are aiming to high)</li><li>Decrease scope and remove planned but not strictly necessary features</li></ul><h3 id=harder-to-build>Harder to Build</h3><ul><li>Techdebt</li><li>In a more difficult <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework>Cynefin domain</a>.</li><li>Blocked waiting on something else to get built</li><li>Cross team, valuestream or platform work is required</li><li>Works against your core technology differentiators</li><li>Available engineers don&rsquo;t have proper experience</li></ul><h2 id=watch-out-for-local-optimizations>Watch out for local optimizations</h2><p>As discussed in my post on quick sorting, we want to avoid trying to micro prioritize issues and initiatives. Our ability to accurately estimate the granular value or effort of our work in advance is limited. You are looking to draw out information you missed that would move an idea or initiative between the big columns in our sorting process. Changing our value score from a 2 to a 3 or a 2 to a 5 is significant in our course sorting. Trying to change the sort order inside of a column is less useful. We probably in the long run can&rsquo;t tell the difference in outcomes between <code>Idea 3</code> being marginally more important than <code>Idea 7</code> if both ideas still have a value of 2.</p><div class=fig_container><figure><div><img class=figureimg loading=lazy src=moving-between-columns.png></div><div></div></figure></div></main></div></div><hr><div class=social-links><ul><li><a href="https://shareopenly.org/share/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nortrup.dev%2fposts%2fan-officiant-s-wedding-script%2f&text=An%20officiant%27s%20wedding%20script">Share This</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/AndyNortrup rel=me>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/Nortrup rel=me>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=mailto:andy@nortrup.dev rel=me>E-Mail</a></li><li><a href=https://social.seattle.wa.us/@andy rel=me>Mastodon ‚ÅÇ</a></li><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/nortrup.dev rel=me>Bluesky</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
