I do this with an incredibly ugly Clojure script that I wrote to learn Clojure. But I do think the metrics themselves have been a helpful lens to look at what is happening. Here are some of the questions I ask myself when I sit down to analyze the metrics.</p><p>First, some qualifications:</p><ul><li>I pull metrics monthly with weekly intervals.</li><li>I pull metrics at the portfolio level (lead by a Sr. Director of PM) I have occasionally pulled the metrics for my own projects. But the portfolio level feels closest to the value stream customers buy and also hits a nice balance of me doing the analysis in my spare time.</li><li>I pull metrics entirely from JIRA. I know that I have some blind spots by doing that and my connectivity index is low; but it is what I have.</li></ul><p>Things I look for:</p><ul><li>Is velocity increasing? As a growing product company, we generally want to see velocity increasing. Either by improving our systems of work or by adding more people to the company.</li><li>Did the velocity change at a reasonable rate.<ul><li>If I see big spikes, I worry that someone is on a death march to get a feature out</li><li>If I see big dips, I worry that a new impediment has arisen and needs to be stabilized.</li></ul></li><li>Does the distribution of flow items match the stated strategy?<ul><li>If we are focused on the SaaS business, I expect to see more tasks.</li><li>If we just released a major update, I expect to see more bugs.</li><li>If we are in the middle of pushing a big update out, I expect to see more features.</li></ul></li><li>Are the active time, flow time, and flow efficiency pretty even?<ul><li>Big variations are an indicator that the system of work is not consistent.</li></ul></li><li>Are the active time, flow time, and flow efficiency improving?<ul><li>Much like velocity, we should be doing consistent work to improve the system of work and improve our flow time and efficiency.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Most of these questions will lead me to dig in further to what is happening in detail with the problems I see. I&rsquo;m leaning towards trying to fix issues with flow consistency and speed over trying to address velocity directly. So if I see velocity stuck or declining I tend to look for problems that show up in flow time rather than problems that show up with velocity directly?</p><p>Hopefully, this helps you have some thoughts to start looking at your own flow metrics.</p></main></div></div><hr><div class=social-links><ul><li><a href="https://shareopenly.org/share/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nortrup.dev%2fposts%2fan-officiant-s-wedding-script%2f&text=An%20officiant%27s%20wedding%20script">Share This</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/AndyNortrup rel=me>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/Nortrup rel=me>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=mailto:andy@nortrup.dev rel=me>E-Mail</a></li><li><a href=https://social.seattle.wa.us/@andy rel=me>Mastodon ‚ÅÇ</a></li><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/nortrup.dev rel=me>Bluesky</a></li></ul></div></body></html>
