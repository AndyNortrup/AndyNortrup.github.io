I would rather be interviewed for a job than interview someone for a job. If I have to choose between written and oral communication, I will usually prefer to write. I like async communication because I have time to think clearly and then commit to words what I&rsquo;m thinking. I have a mild central auditory processing disorder, meaning an in-person interview pushes my limits of listening, and critically processing, and taking notes on answers in real time. Critical assessment of the candidate&rsquo;s answer will probably be the functional task that drops.</p><p>There are lots of complaints about the interview process, mine is that I have a hard time going from just a resume for context to a fully formed opinion in 45 minutes. I frequently walk out of an interview feeling good but wanting to ask follow up questions the next morning, or realize that I didn&rsquo;t get a full answer to a question.</p><p>Lastly almost every job description asks for applicants with strong written and verbal communication skills. But the average interview loop only tests your written communication skills by asking for a resume, which is not real writing.</p><p>I would love to see an interview format that goes as follows:</p><ol><li>I read your resume, write a few questions and send them to the candidate</li><li>You respond, with a soft commitment not to spend much more that 20-30 minutes answering</li><li>Candidate and interviewer have the option to go back and forth a few times on specifics or follow ups</li><li>The candidate comes in for an on-site or VTC discussion of ~20 minutes per person to talk on the same subject as the emails</li></ol><p>I&rsquo;m not looking for a laborious homework assignment, just have a format that allows me to not feel rushed into an assessment.</p></main></div></div><hr><div class=footer><a href="https://shareopenly.org/share/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nortrup.dev%2fposts%2fan-officiant-s-wedding-script%2f&text=An%20officiant%27s%20wedding%20script">Share This</a>
