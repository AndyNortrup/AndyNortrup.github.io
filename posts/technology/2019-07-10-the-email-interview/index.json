{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t like conducting interviews. I would rather be interviewed for a job than interview someone for a job. If I have to choose between written and oral communication, I will usually prefer to write. I like async communication because I have time to think clearly and then commit to words what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking. I have a mild central auditory processing disorder, meaning an in-person interview pushes my limits of listening, and critically processing, and taking notes on answers in real time. Critical assessment of the candidate\u0026rsquo;s answer will probably be the functional task that drops.\nThere are lots of complaints about the interview process, mine is that I have a hard time going from just a resume for context to a fully formed opinion in 45 minutes. I frequently walk out of an interview feeling good but wanting to ask follow up questions the next morning, or realize that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a full answer to a question.\nLastly almost every job description asks for applicants with strong written and verbal communication skills. But the average interview loop only tests your written communication skills by asking for a resume, which is not real writing.\nI would love to see an interview format that goes as follows:\nI read your resume, write a few questions and send them to the candidate You respond, with a soft commitment not to spend much more that 20-30 minutes answering Candidate and interviewer have the option to go back and forth a few times on specifics or follow ups The candidate comes in for an on-site or VTC discussion of ~20 minutes per person to talk on the same subject as the emails I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for a laborious homework assignment, just have a format that allows me to not feel rushed into an assessment.\n","permalink":"https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/2019-07-10-the-email-interview/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t like conducting interviews.
