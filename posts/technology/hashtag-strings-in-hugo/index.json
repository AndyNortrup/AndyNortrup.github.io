[{"content":"I did a fun bit of Hugo templating today that seemed worth sharing. I was previously generating my list of hashtags to apply to a social post inside of my Zapier workflow. I\u0026rsquo;d pull the list of tags then manipulate them into a single string and add the # symbol.\nToday I realized that this would be much simpler to do in Hugo as part of my JSON output.

I needed to do three things:\n Title case the words so we get ProductManagement, rather than Productmanagement or productmanagement. Remove the spaces. Converts the list to a single string that I can just plop into a post.  Now I have one field that I can put into a post. I find that zero code workflows are best when simplest. Doing variable manipulation with them is never elegant.\n","hashtags":"#Technology #Hugo","permalink":"https://www.nortrup.dev/posts/technology/hashtag-strings-in-hugo/","summary":"I did a fun bit of Hugo templating today that seemed worth sharing.
